# PLANNING STORY
After creating the user stories, the first thing planned was the backend API. The resources for the project were designed and relationships between resources were defined.  This process was described by the ERD.  The next part was deciding on implementation of the desired outcome on the front end. Wireframes were constructed and pseudo code written to describe the actions before starting the coding process.
